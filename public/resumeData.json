Lots has been thrown at him since he arrived, many new technologies and a lot about our business. He’s taking the time to understand all of it. He is very inquisitive, always wanting to learn all that he can, not just about his immediate task but he looks broader. I can tell he is a fast learner and applying what he has learned in school so far. I wish we were all back in the office together as that would give Pratya an even better experience, but I can safely say that he’s making the best of the situation for sure. I expect at the end of the summer that we’ll have many fully functional tests for our automation which will be a huge value add and he will have learned a lot about our applications, automation, our team and our company.
